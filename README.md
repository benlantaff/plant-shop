# plant-shop

E-commerce site for selling plants. This is just for fun, but with a few tweaks this could be a real world application.

To start the server: `node index.js`

# Shop

Front end / UI for the shop.
To start the application: `npm run dev`

# Notes

For both projects, make sure to run `npm install` first.
